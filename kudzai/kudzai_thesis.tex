%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}%

Sentiment analysis has proven to be one of the most challenging tasks in natural language processing (NLP).
%
Many AI systems have been developed which can detect the polarity of a sentence (degree of positivity, neutrality or negativity). But more information such as the emotion of the author can be detected.
Our task here is to build an artificial agent -- or an AI system -- that is capable of detecting polarity in a document as well as the emotion of the author.
%
Generally speaking sentiment analysis detects the polarity of the opinion based on the object/subject in discussion.
%
But emotion detection can identify the particular ``mood'' of the author.
%
Social platforms -- such as Facebook, Twitter, IMDB, or comment sections from online newspapers -- to name a few -- can provide a huge corpus of -- usually unlabelled or extremely sparsely labelled -- content.

Using modern machine learning tools and the available computational power, an agent can analyse the content -- given usually as a list of messages -- and detect the general emotion ``within the message''.
%
It must be capable of identifying subjects with unstable or ``chaotic'' mood that might require attention.

Our aim is to attempt detecting the underlying emotion as well as the polarity of a document.
%
In this process we will make use of open source libraries and publicly available data sets.
%
The program will be able to run locally, both in geographic and in cultural sense, and to analyse the results that were obtained.
