\section{Data visualization}
Because of the way the human brain processes information, using charts or graphs to visualize large amounts of complex data is easier than poring over spreadsheets or reports. 
Data visualization makes it easier to identify areas that need attention.

\subsection{matplotlib and seaborn}
Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
Matplotlib allows plotting multiple graphs on a single figure. Analysis can be made on different metrics at the same time. It also allows updating graph data in realtime.

The \textbf{wordcloud} gives a summary of the tweets in realtime.\\
The \textbf{timeseries} gives a \textbf{stochastic trend} of the polarity of the tweets, with \textbf{1 = positive, -1 = negative and 0 = neutral}.
The \textbf{barchart} displays the values of the number of tweets in the given category\\
The \textbf{heat map} shows the \textbf{polarity} as well as the \textbf{subjectivity} in terms of percentage,
a negative and subjective scenario is the least desirable while a positive and objective scenario is the most desirable.\\

With this realtime analysis one can quickly see the prevailing mood as well as a summary of the tweets around a given topic.
