\section{Linear discriminant}\label{sec:THEORY:linear}

There is often equation:
\begin{equation}
	f: \Omega_x \rightarrow {\mathbb{R}}
	\quad\text{ such that }
	\quad f(x)
	\begin{cases}
		<0 & \forall x\in Neg \\
		\geq 0 & \forall x\in Poz
	\end{cases}
	\label{eq:diszkr:fugg}
\end{equation}



If an equation is not very important, one can use the \$\$ notation...

$$D_k(x)=\tilde{x}^T\alpha_k=\alpha_k^T\tilde{x},$$
